    <h2>Closed Meeting Preamble</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>Hi, I'm _____ and I'm an alcoholic.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the Wednesday night men's meeting of the Cosmopolitan Group, both in Little Rock and abroad. </p>

    <p>This is a closed meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. In support of A.A.'s singleness of purpose, attendance at closed meetings is limited to persons who have a desire to stop drinking. If you think you have a problem with alcohol, you are welcome to attend this meeting. We ask that when discussing our problems, we confine ourselves to those problems as they relate to alcoholism.</p>

    <p>Since this is a closed meeting, if any of you are in a public place or around non-alcoholics, some here might appreciate you using headphones. To minimize background noise, I've muted everyone, but you can un-mute yourself at any time. Remember to do that when sharing.</p>

    <p>Please join me in a moment of silence, followed by the Serenity prayer.</p>

    <p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.</p>

    <p>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>

    <p>Are there any newcomers, and would you like to introduce yourself by your first name?</p>

    <p>Are there any AA birthdays?</p>

    <p>Are there any AA-related announcements? </p>

    <p>The Wednesday night men's meeting has a long history of emphasizing sponsorship. Does anyone here need a sponsor?</p>

    <p>There is a Slack group related to this meeting that members use to stay in touch and share information. If you'd like to join the Slack group, please contact Matt R and he'll get you set up. Park wherever the fuck you want.</p>

    <p>I've asked _____ to read "How it Works".</p>
